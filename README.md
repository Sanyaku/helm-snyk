# Check your Helm chart for vulnerabilities

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/snyk-labs/helm-snyk/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/snyk-labs/helm-snyk/tree/master)

The Helm plugin for [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) provides a subcommand for testing the images in a given Helm chart for known vulnerabilities.

## Installation

Install the plugin using the built-in `helm plugin` command:

```
helm plugin install https://github.com/snyk-labs/helm-snyk
```

The plugin connects to the Snyk service to lookup vulnerability information. If you don't have a Snyk account, go to [snyk.io/login](https://snyk.io/login) to sign up for free. You can then obtain an access token from [app.snyk.io/account](https://app.snyk.io/account) or for information on using service accounts, see [snyk.io/docs/service-accounts/](https://snyk.io/docs/service-accounts/).

Once you have an account, you should set the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable:

```
export SNYK_TOKEN=<your-snyk-token>
```

The plugin also requires a local Docker installation and uses this to download and test each of the images discovered in the chart.


## Usage

With the plugin installed, simply run the new `helm snyk test` command and point it to the directory of the chart. For instance:

```console
$ helm snyk test stable/redis
Image: docker.io/bitnami/redis:5.0.5-debian-9-r181

```

The plugin also supports the various arguments for modifying the chart, including `--set` and `--values`. So for instance you can test the same chart but override the image tag like so: 

```console
helm snyk test --set image.tag=latest
```

As well as the user-friendly output above the plugin also supports outputting the results as a JSON document. This can be useful for further analysis or integration with other tooling.

```console
$ helm snyk test stable/mysql --json
{
  "helmChart": "mysql@1.3.0",
  "images": [
    {
      "imageName": "dduportal/bats:0.4.0",
      "results": {
        "vulnerabilities": [

# Development
To get this compiling (since it's built on node10) I have had to do the following.  Assumes `nvm` and `asdf` w/its python plugin are installed:

```bash
asdf local python 2.7.18
nvm install 10
nvm use 10
```

Because I don't have access to the CI environment (which probably fails due to asking for the latest node LTS), I have had
to build and install locally:

```bash
# the helm plugin install creates a symlink to this dir, but also downloads the latest release binary from snyk-labs.
# this is not our version, so we overwrite it in the next step.
helm plugin install .  
npm run build && npm run pkg && cp helm-snyk-macos bin
```
